	<h2>ABOUT HALODOME</h2>  
    <div class="col-sm-10 col-lg-8 aboutParagraph">
    	<p>Halodome is a pre-fabricated timber building designed to ship anywhere in the world for a multitude of uses “a house, a studio, a showroom a workshop, whatever you want” as founder Tim Oulton says.</p>
        <p>The design uses a high level of airtightness and insulation to achieve ultra low energy consumption. Triple-glazed doors and windows, of the highest available European quality, are preinstalled into the finished panels and can be positioned in various configurations to suit the location and orientation of the building. A highly efficient ventilation and energy recovery system constantly replenishes fresh air ensuring the temperature inside remains constant and comfortable all year round.</p>
        <p>The 13 meter diameter column free dome is made up of 70 individual pre-finished panels transported to site in standard shipping containers. The panels use fully certified PEFC timber framing and reclaimed timber linings that bolt together on a level concrete ground slab preinstalled by the customer. Exterior battening and roofing shingles are then fitted, followed by taping of the airtight interior membranes and installation of the timber linings to complete the basic dome shell. A standard Halodome provides approximately 160m2 of floor area if the standard design half floor mezzanine and spiral staircase are installed.</p>
        <p>Pricing is dependent on specific design requirements, however the basic kit includes all the components necessary to construct a free standing weathertight dome shell with interior reclaimed timber linings. The 70 factory produced panels that form the structure incorporate, insulation, air tight membranes and factory fitted high performance windows and doors. Canadian red cedar roof shingles and treated battens are supplied for cladding onsite along with all stainless steel door and window flashings and a stainless steel dome cap. The structure is accredited by UK structural engineers to UK standards and can also be supplied to meet Passivhaus standard, the highest in the world for energy conservation.</p>
